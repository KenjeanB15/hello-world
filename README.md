Mackentorch here, but you can call me Mack if you'd like. 

I am passionate about programming because not only is it something I enjoy doing but I believe it is an essential skill that will allow me to make the biggest impact in the lives of those around me. My immediate goal is to become the best computer programmer I can be in order to land my first job. My longterm goals include teaching local public school students in NYC how to program. I am currently participating in Cedecademy's premium bootcamp program in order to level up my skills to accomplish those goals.
